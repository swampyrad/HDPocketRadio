# Pocket Radio

A radio item made to play customized music in-game in the form of a more "immersive" radio item. It acts as a Slot 8 weapon and has a max of 99 Channels.

To add music to this addon, copy your music files into "root/music", and rename them to "rdiochXY", where XY is the number of the channel you  want to use to play that song.
Once you've done that, you can either load the mod as a folder, .zip or .pk3 and it should automatically load your music in-game.

Pocket Radio channel format:
(do not use ch. 0, start from ch. 1)
"radioch1"  -  music for ch. 1
"radioch9"  -  music for ch. 9
"radioch10" -  music for ch. 10
"radioch99" -  music for ch. 99

Available channels range from 1-99.
